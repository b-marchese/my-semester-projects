# my-semester-projects
This repository contains my top 5 programs I created in python during the first semester of AP Computer Science Principles. 

### Project 1: 
**Summary**: This is a game where you start with a base level pokemon (pichu) and you try and upgrade to the max level pokemon (raichu). You can train the pokemon or battle top gain experience or you could have a break day and rest. All done playing for the day? No worries you can conveniently save the game then quit and load it in later!
**Key Features**: 
- 3 evolutions of pokemon
- Displays pokemon level, evolution status, and what day it is 
- super fun vibes!!!!
